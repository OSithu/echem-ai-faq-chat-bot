## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About Free Tier Limitations
- **Sleep time**: Some free tier services go to sleep after 30 mins of inactivity
- **Bandwidth**: Limited but usually sufficient for small projects
- **Storage**: Usually 500MB-2GB which is plenty for our app
- **CPU/Memory**: Lower but acceptable for starter projects

### Upgrading Later
- Replit: $7/month for "unlimited" resources
- Railway: Pay as you go (usually $5-10/month for small apps)
- These are still very affordable compared to AWS/GCP
